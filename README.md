ISARIC is committed to strengthening evidence generation for emerging outbreaks. In the context of the rise of Mpox infections, we have partnered with global experts to tailor our clinical epidemiology platform to inform clinical care and health policy. A suite of standardised tools is openly available to support your research and facilitate global collaboration where requested. These tools include: 
 
STANDARDISED PROTOCOL: Based on the ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol, a template Mpox characterisation protocol is available for sites to tailor, submit for appropriate approvals, and implement. The protocol is designed in modules so that sites can select the research questions and corresponding investigations to match their priorities and availability of research resources.  
 
CASE REPORT FORM (CRF): This standardised data collection form includes variables needed to efficiently characterise the natural history of mpox across clades, regions, time and populations. It is structured to quickly identify risk factors for severe outcomes, understand the mechanisms of disease, and provide key numbers to inform the design of clinical trials.  
 
CRF and DATABASE GENERATOR ([BRIDGE]{https://isaricresearch.github.io/Training/bridge_starting.html}): The [BRIDGE]{https://isaric-bridge.replit.app/} tool is used to create the files needed to launch a database for your CRF. You can select the standard mpox template or add and remove variables so that it is tailored to your patients and your context. After deciding on your final CRF, BRIDGE generates (1) an XML file and data dictionary that can be uploaded to REDCap for a ready-to-use database, and (2) a paper CRF and CRF completion guide that support data quality.  
 
Instructions on REDCap installation are available for sites that do not currently host this software. ISARIC offers data hosting support for sites that are not able to host their own database. 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN (SAP): A template SAP that corresponds to the protocol and CRF is available to tailor and follow. 
 
ANALYTIC CODE ([VERTEX]{https://isaricresearch.github.io/Training/insight_panel.html}): A suite of code, written to generate the analyses described in the SAP using the ISARIC data structures is available for open use. VERTEX includes python code to produce the tables, visualisations and results that address the research questions in the protocol.   
  
When assembled, the ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform offers a standardised PROTOCOL → CRF → DATABASE → ANALYSIS PLAN → ANALYTIC CODE based on a machine-readable data schema that is mapped to robust data standards and controlled terminologies. This promotes data quality and provenance and facilitates data aggregation for collaborative analysis.
